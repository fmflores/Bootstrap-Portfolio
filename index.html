            My name is Frank Flores. I got my Associates in Computer Science
            with an emphasis in programming in 2018. I currently work as a field
            technician troubleshooting desktops, laptops, servers, switches,
            routers, etc. as well as work with cabling and cable management.
            Before that I worked for Trader Joe's for 10+ years and really
            enjoyed it, but had the chance to work with computer and network
            hardware/software and took that plunge.
          </p>

          <p>
            Just recently I got a offered a position doing tier 2 IT support and
            am looking forward to working in this type of environment. Apart
            from always being interested in hardware/software and PC support, I
            have taken courses in C++, Java, and was teaching myself Python but
            put that on hold while I take this Full Stack Web Development
            course. I plan on contuining with the Python lessons after the
            bootcamp ends to try and tie in Python with web development.
          </p>

          <p>
            Besides school and work, I enjoy rock climbing (indoors and
            outdoors), grew up skateboarding and although I don't skate much
            anymore (or was every really good), I still watch and get excited
            when a new skate video comes out. I live in South Pasadena, CA and
            love going to concerts/shows. Music has and will always be a big
            part of my life and who I am.
